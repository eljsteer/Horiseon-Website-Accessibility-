# Horiseon Digital Marketing Agency Website Accessibility Update

## Have refactored the website to improve it's accessibility features to allow for all people to access the content with ease and to improve the website's position in Google searches.

- Inspiration to refactor Horiseon's website was to provide improved access to Horiseon's Website to all people regardless of whichever limitations they may experience. I wanted to solve Horiseons wbesite accessibility issues as it is important anyone who wishes can access the business provides quality servivces for any businesses wanting to improve their digital exposure.

## Updates

-   Addition of semantic elements to the website to improve accssibility for screen readers
-   Addition of comments for subsequent developers to quickly and easily pick up the code and make further changes and improvements.
-   Improvements to the navigation around the site with corrected links and highlighting to links when the user hovers over link to improve navigation around site for users who have visual impairments and not able to easily follow mouse movement.
-   Scout ruling applied by cleaning up the css code by collating multiple elements and simplifying the code. Also improved the layout of the html code by adding line spaces between semantic coe sections.
-   Updated titles to provide more clarity for the code.
-   Addition of Alt elements with detailed image description text to all images to improve accesibility.

## Skills and Knowledge learned

I learned a lot from all aspects on this project.
- A refresher to Html knowledge and workings especially regarding semantics, also with the parent-child relationships and how each level is accessed by css.
- Huge learning curve with css. I learnt a lot about the box model, how elements relate with changes in resolution size in the viewport e.g. max width or min height etc and various measurements such as %,em, and rem. I added comments to css code for the first time as there was a large amount of css code and to break it down into the sections of the website.
- Special learning mention goes to the addition of a white bottom border to the listed links when the user hovers their mouse over the link to help users navigate around the website with more ease.
